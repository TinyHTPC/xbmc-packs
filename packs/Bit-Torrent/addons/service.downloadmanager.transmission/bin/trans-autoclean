# This script will remove torrents that have been downloaded and seeded by Transmission.
# The idea is to set a seeding limit in CP, SB & Transmission that will stop torrent that have been downloaded and seeded.
# The best apporach when setting download folder is to have separate folders for SB, CP and other Transmission downloads.
# Add appropriate line to your crontab like "0 * * * * /usr/bin/transmission_clean.sh 1> /dev/null", this will initiate the script once an hour without logging.
# I'm not the original author of the script so license is
