- Slight Adjustments made to the Download Function(s).
- To use either download Feature, remember to dissable the Auto-Play option in Settings so you can view the list of links.
- JDownloader Feature Made Available.  This could use a short little test by those who have it setup, with dropping me a message on the forum or IRC Chat to let me know how well it's working.
- Download Feature Made Available.  This includes the same type of Download-Methods as in my SolarMovie.so addon.
- Along with Genre(Select), the OldMenu feature now provides a method to view the Last... stuff in a submenu in order to work around any issues with refreshing the main menu when ran from a shortcut on the MainScreen of XBMC.
- Check out Settings for a Genre and All|#|A-Z Style changer to change the graphics for the 2 folder listings.  At this moment it looked like some links with -'s were having problems so some icons for 'ALL' don't seem to want to show up.

### AutoPlay feature seems to be working now for: Default (Default URL) | Next (Next Url is usually the highest quality Url I think.) | Last (Last is usually the lowest quality Url I think.).
### I've switched from enables for alternative autoplay options to a enum switch under General tab in Settings.
### In the end I had to save info at listEpisodes() to call later to go back to there after play, so to prevent the continual re-play issue.
### Tried a check via the title and url... that didn't help much if any at all.
### Many problems with list auto-refreshes causing it to be hard to get out of playing a video with auto-play on.
- Working on an AutoPlay Feature.

- Option added to Settings for dissabling the view of Favorites 2-4.

- _DoGetItems(), Select_AZ(), Select_Sort(), Select_Genre() added for the new choice list(s) method.  You can now choose All, Numbers (0-9), or A-Z for the Anime List.
- MetaHandler import added to addon.xml as a requirement.

[B]Version 0.2.9[/B]
