MySQL Connector/Python is implementing the MySQL Client/Server protocol
completely in Python. This means you don't have to compile anything or MySQL
(client library) doesn't even have to be installed on the machine.

Ah, and make backups!

'tar ball' you download:

  shell> unzip mysql-connector-python-0.2.0-devel.zip
    or
  shell> tar xzf mysql-connector-python-0.2.0-devel.tar.gz

Then simply execute the setup.py script with the 'install' argument:

  shell> cd mysql-connector-python-0.2.0/
  shell> python setup.py install

setup.py will figure out which Python version you have and install the
