[B]New Features[/B]
A lot of new features have been added to 1Channel recently, most importantly the Help button. Most of your questions should be answered after a read through there.

[COLOR red]If you still have questions afterward, this addon is supported at [COLOR blue]www.XBMCHub.com[/COLOR],  [COLOR white][B]NOT[/B][/COLOR] xbmc.org[/COLOR].

[COLOR blue][B]UK Users Blocked[/B][/COLOR]
    As of November 21st, UK ISP's - BT, Sky, Virgin Media, O2, EE and TalkTalk have begun blocking various websites including PrimeWire (formerly 1Channel)
    
    To combat this, new domain options have been added to help our UK users bypass the restrictions.
    
    If you are on one of these ISP's and cannot access www.primewire.ag then open the addon settings and select one of the alternate domain names
        - http://1channel.occupyuk.co.uk
        - http://primewireproxy.co.uk
    
    If for any reason none of these domains work for you, please visit [COLOR blue]www.XBMCHub.com[/COLOR] for OFFICIAL support. You can also enter your own Custom Domain if any of the above do not work.

[COLOR blue][B]Subscriptions' Day Menus[/B][/COLOR]
    A request had been heard for a while about adding the days of the week to either Favorites or Subscriptions.  Subscriptions now can include a Day marking of the current day they are added as, updated to the current day of the week, or the day marking removed.  Also you can view all subscriptions, or view subscriptions marked with a specific day of the week.  Psst!  Thank TwiztedZero for his suggested mind-control of me, if you come to like this.  You can also edit the label formating of this in addon-settings.

[COLOR blue][B]Error Handling[/B][/COLOR]
    Error handling has been added in many place, most of all to logging, for sake of unhandled text.  This should help solve several of the script errors that accured due to unhandled text being printed to xbmc.log that would cause an error.

[COLOR blue][B]PrimeWire.ag[/B][/COLOR]
    November of 2013 has come around and PrimeWire.ag has been the mainly used domain for 1Channel for quite some time now.  It was about time for a graphics to be updated.  Icon and Fanart were updated from what was made by fans a while back.  Also a new temp thing has been included called PrimeWire.  A lot of the 1Channel Text has also been switched to PrimeWire, within the addon.

[COLOR blue][B]1Channel.ch under attack[/B][/COLOR]
    -On 01May2013, www.1channel.ch was attacked and the domain hijacked. The site is currently available under the old domain www.letmewatchthis.ch. Until further notice, please
    [COLOR red]DO NOT[/COLOR] use www.1channel.ch and especially do not attempt to log in there. If you have tried to login there, visit www.letmewatchthis.ch and change
    your password immediately. 
    
    This updated version of the addon allows you to select to use 1channel.ch or letmewatchthis.ch via a setting under Miscellaneous -> Domain. Until the team behind the
    1channel/letmewatchthis site give the all clear, please leave this set to Letmewatchthis.ch. You can keep up with them on Twitter @real_1channel.

Here's a quick rundown of things that have changed or that you might not know about:

[COLOR blue][B]Add to Library[/B][/COLOR]
    - Create .strm files to link directly to 1Ch content from your XBMC library
        - In order for 1Channel content to show up in your XBMC library, you need to add the Tv Shows and Movies folders as sources in XBMC. 
        This can be done through Videos-> Files-> Add Videos...-> Browse and navigating to and selecting the appropriate folder. Once you have selected the appropriate folder, 
        enter a name of your choosing for the source and select ok. In the Set Content screen, select the type of content (Tv Shows or Movies) and the scraper you want XBMC 
        to use to identify each piece of content and download metadata.
        
        The next time XBMC's library updates, the new content will show up in your library as if you had downloaded the whole file and saved it locally

[COLOR blue][B]Subscriptions[/B][/COLOR]
    - Automatically create .strm files when a new episode of a subscribed show is added to the website
        - Subscriptions work exactly like the Add to Library feature with the added benefit that the addon checks periodically for new episodes and automatically adds new episodes
        to your library as they appear on the site

[COLOR blue][B]Sorting of sources[/B][/COLOR]
    - You can specify the order in which to present sources ranked by the host, quality, number of views, number or parts, and whether or not the source is listed as verified on the site
        - The Host Ranking field allows you to specify the order in which you prefer hosts to be listed. The host listed first will be ranked highest, and so on.
           For example:
            
                putlocker.com, sockshare.com, vidxden.com 

        - To give two hosts equal prefrence, separate them with the | character:
           For example:
            
                putlocker.com|sockshare.com, vidxden.com, nowvideo.eu
 
        - Any hosts not listed will be given an equal ranking lower than all listed hosts.
        - Enabling Reverse Sort after a sorting option will sort them appropriately, then reverse the list

[COLOR blue][B]Autoplay[/B][/COLOR]
    - When enabled, the list of sources won't be displayed. Instead, the list will be sorted according to your prefrences and will be tried in order until playback is successful.

[COLOR blue][B]Autowatch[/B][/COLOR]
    - Automatically mark a movie or episode as watched when playback reaches a specified percentage
    - Keep in mind that this only affects items displayed within the addon. It is not currently possible to mark items as watched in your library this way

[COLOR blue][B]MySQL support[/B][/COLOR]
    - Share subscriptions and favorites across multiple installations

[COLOR blue][B]Website Integration[/B][/COLOR]
    - View and save your favorites to/from the www.1channel.ch website

[COLOR blue][B]Themes[/B][/COLOR]
    - Switch up the artwork in 1channel

[COLOR blue][B]Label formatting[/B][/COLOR]
    - Control how content and source labels are displayed
        The following tokens can be used:
            {t} The unchanged title of the Movie or TV Show
            {y} The unchanged release year of the Movie or TV Show
            {ft} The title of the Movie or TV Show after applying any formatting specified in the Title field
            {fy} The release year of the Movie or TV Show after applying any formatting specified in the Year field
            {q} The quality of the source as specified on the website (DVD, TS, or CAM)
            {h} The host of the source
            {v} The number of views reported by the website
            {p} The part number of the specified source
